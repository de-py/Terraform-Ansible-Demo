# Terraform (and Ansible) Demo

This project is being created to learn and test the capabilities of Terraform and Ansible. The focus of Terraform and Ansible will be to develop a full lab for testing offensive security techniques and detection capabilities. 

## Project Guidelines

Wherever possible this project will try to use infrastructure as code and native configuration management modules to reduce the need for custom scripts.
