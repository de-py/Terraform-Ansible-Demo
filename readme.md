# Terraform (and Ansible) Demo

This project is being created to learn and test the capabilities of Terraform and Ansible. The focus of Terraform and Ansible will be to develop a full lab for testing offensive security techniques and detection capabilities. 

## Project Guidelines

Wherever possible this project will try to use infrastructure as code and native configuration management modules to reduce the need for custom scripts. That said, the initial set up of this demo may use scripts until I learn more about the methods for building in configuration.
